# ShePlanOnMyPlotTillIPlimax
A tool which uses spectral graph theory and analytic tools of linear algebra to create intuitive urban planning visualizations and simulations.

This project capitalizes on tools available in graph theory to perform complex analysis on urban constructs. Urban constructs are composed of physical, infrastructural, political, social, and other networks which lay on top of eachother to compose the space. While the definition of such constructs is ambiguous and debated in urban planning theory, it is most often agreed that such constructs can be abstracted to graphs. This tool seeks to create a functional relationship between urban networks and the mathematical tools of graph theory, which will provide designers with the ability to do systems based analysis, complex network analysis, and policy outcome evaluation in interdependent-variable contexts more easily. Compared to other frameworks, using graph theory simplifies various aspects of data processing, and allows for the structural inclusion of theoretical constraints and best practices in urban planning within the logical framework of graph manipulation and transformation.
